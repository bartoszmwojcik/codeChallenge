This package contains set of small programs created for practice, improvement of development skills in Haskell. Important part in the creation of the programs is chatgpt4 by openai, that helped in some cases partially, providing elements of the program, in same cases created full solution upon request and few feedbacks about bugs and errors.

Use:
- build with stack: 'stack build'
- run of each program separately: 'stack run <name>', eg. 'stack run fourier'.
